    <h1>Inline and Block elements</h1>
    <p><b>Inline elements: Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary</b></p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Block-level elements are those that start on a new line and take up the entire width of their container by default.they essentially claim all the horizontal space for themselves, pushing any content that comes after them to a new line</b></p>

    <!-- when we used css on p tag it took the entire web page 
    and when we used on anchor tag it only uses till the word ends and it does not take up the entire space 
    Here
    p tag is a block element and a tag is an inline element
    -->
